What is Bitcoin Green?
----------------
Bitcoin Green is an experimental digital currency fork of Bircoin. 
Bitcoin Green is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin Green uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Green is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.



Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/ghsourav/Bitcoin-Green) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
